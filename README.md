## Challenge

### Challenge Details

API Endpoint: Digital Product Passport Data
The data provided contains verifiable credentials for a car battery. Your challenge is to fetch this data, process it, and present it in a dynamic and interactive front-end application.

### Requirements

#### Data Handling

Fetch data from the provided API and handle potential errors (e.g., invalid responses, network issues).
Process the data as needed to display key information in a structured manner.

#### Dynamic Interface

Build interactive components to display the data (e.g., expandable sections, filtering options, or sortable tables).
Ensure the application responds to user actions in a meaningful way.

#### Focus on Functionality

Styling is not the primary focus; a basic, clean design is sufficient. However, the UI should be clear and functional.
Ensure the interface is responsive and works on different screen sizes.

#### Interactivity

Include interactive elements such as:
Filters for specific data fields (e.g., product specifications).
Search functionality for quick navigation.
Charts or tables that allow users to explore the data dynamically.

#### Bonus Features (Optional)

Implement creative or innovative ways to visualize complex data to enhance user understanding.
Add features like real-time data updates or additional pages for detailed insights.
